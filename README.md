# angular-starter

> A static angular.js starter template

## Usage

use webpack and angular to use commonjs syntax, require files

## Getting Started

```sh
$ npm install -g webpack
$ git clone git@github.com:jasonshark/angular-starter.git
$ cd angular-starter
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

This starts webpack-dev-server on **http://localhost:8080** and serves the built bundle.js file to index.html. It will also rebuild changes every time you save a file. Refresh the webpage to see your updated code
